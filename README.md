# [TITS2024] GLAD: Global-Local MAV Detection under Challenging Conditions based on Appearance and Motion 

This is an official pytorch implementation of the 2024 IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems paper: 

Global-Local MAV Detection under Challenging Conditions based on Appearance and Motion

This repository contains the basic codes for GLAD, the full codes with Kalman Filter, Adaptive Search Region, and other codes will be published in the future. 

# Quick Start for GLAD
demo file for GLAD
```bash
python GLAD.py
```
# GLAD_MC
demo file for GLAD with motion compensation

## Installation

Please find installation instructions in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

## Train

If you want to train on your own datasets, you should re-train global YOLOv5, local YOLOv5, and the appearance-based classifier.
